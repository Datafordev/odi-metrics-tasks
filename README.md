# Open Organisation Services

This repository is for code for services that support ODI's operation as an open organisation. Our aim is to publish open data as a mechanism to help us function more effectively, and to act as a demonstrator of both the technical and policy challenges.

Our first 2-week sprint starts on 4th February. We're using [the issues](https://github.com/theodi/open-orgn-services/issues) to scope and track what we're doing.
